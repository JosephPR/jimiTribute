          <strong> James Marshall Hendrix </strong><br>(born Johnny Allen Hendrix;
          November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an
          American rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter.
          Although his mainstream career spanned only four years,
          he is widely regarded as one of the most influential
          electric guitarists in the history of popular music,
          and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th
          century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him
          as<em> "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history
            of rock music"</em></h3>

            <strong> Hey Joe</strong><br>
            Released in 1967, the Jimi Hendrix Experience's first single,
            "Hey Joe," was an instant smash in Britain and was soon followed by
            hits such as "Purple Haze" and "The Wind Cries Mary."

            On tour to support his first album, Are You Experienced? (1967),
            Hendrix delighted audiences with his outrageous guitar playing
            skills and his innovative, experimental sound. In June 1967 he also won over
            American music fans with his stunning performance at
            the Monterey Pop Festival, which ended with Hendrix lighting his guitar on fire.</h3>

            <strong> Jimi Hendrix – Belly Button Window Lyrics</strong><br>
            Well. I'm up here in this womb
            I'm looking all around
            Well, I'm looking out my belly button window
            And I see a whole lot of frowns
            And I'm wondering if they don't want me around

            What seems to be the fuzz out there?
            Just what seems to be the hang?
            'Cause you know if ya just don't want me this time around,
            Yeah I'll be glad to go back to Spirit Land
            And even take a longer rest,
            Before I'm coming down the chute again
            Man, I sure remember the last time, baby
            They were still hawkin' about me then
            So if you don't want me now,
            Make up your mind, where or when
            If you don't want me now,
            Give or take, you only got two hundred days
            'Cause I ain't coming down this way too much more again

            You know they got pills for ills and thrills and even spills
            But I think you're just a little too late
            So I'm coming down into this world, daddy
            Regardless of love and hate
            And I'm gonna sit up in your bed, mama
            And just a grin right in your face
            And then I'm gonna eat up all your chocolates,
            And say "I hope I'm not too late"

            So if there's any questions,
            Make up your mind
            'Cause you better give or take
            Questions in your mind
            Give it a take,
            You only got two hundred days

            Way up into this womb
            Looking all around
            Sure's dark in here
            And I'm looking out my belly button window
            And I swear I see nothing but a lot of frowns
            And I'm wondering if they want me around.</h3>

            MUDDY WATERS TURNED HIM ON TO THE GUITAR—AND SCARED THE HELL OUT OF HIM.
            When asked about the guitarists who inspired him, Hendrix cited Buddy Holly,
            Cochran, Elmore James, and B.B. King. But Muddy Waters was the first
            musician who truly made him aware of the instrument. “The first guitarist
            s aware of was Muddy Waters,” Hendrix said. “I heard one of his old records
            I was a
            little boy and it scared me to death because I heard all these sounds.”</h3>
